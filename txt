Based on the PRD.md and the current backend code in backend/app/, here's a breakdown of what's implemented and what's remaining to complete the backend MVP:

  Implemented Features (or partially implemented):


   * User Onboarding: Email registration and phone OTP are implemented. User roles (user, technician, admin) are supported.
   * Technician Onboarding: Profile creation, document upload, and admin-led verification workflow are in place.
   * Repair Request Flow (Basic): Users can create repair jobs with device name, issue description, location, and address.
   * Rule-Based Matching Engine: MatchingService exists, using location and rating to find top technicians, and is integrated into job creation.
   * Job Lifecycle (Partial): Job statuses PENDING and ACCEPTED are handled via API endpoints.
   * Real-time Notifications: A WebSocket endpoint and NotificationManager exist for real-time notifications to users and technicians (e.g., new job opportunities, job accepted).
   * Admin Technician Management: Admins can list pending technicians, view their documents, and approve/reject them.

  Remaining Features to Implement (or complete) in the Backend:


   1. Social Login Integration: The backend currently supports email/phone registration. Social login (e.g., Google, Facebook) is not yet implemented.
   2. Detailed Repair Request Flow:
       * Scheduling/Pickup/Drop Options: The JobCreate model only includes location. There are no explicit fields or logic for user-preferred scheduling (date/time) or pickup/drop-off preferences.
       * Cost Estimate & ETA: There is no mechanism to provide estimated cost ranges or Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to the user during job request.
   3. Enhanced Matching Engine:
       * Skill-based Matching: While TechnicianProfile has a specialization field, the MatchingService does not currently factor this into its matching or scoring logic.
       * Response Time Scoring: The PRD's ranking formula includes response_time_score, which is currently excluded from the MatchingService implementation.
   4. Full Job Lifecycle Management: Endpoints for updating job statuses to IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, READY, CANCELLED, or DISPUTED are missing. Only PENDING and ACCEPTED are explicitly handled.
   5. In-App Messaging System:
       * Message Persistence: The current WebSocket only handles real-time notifications, but messages themselves are not stored in the database as per the PRD requirement ("Messages persist in DB").
       * Dedicated Messaging API: There are no API endpoints for sending and retrieving actual chat messages associated with a specific job or between users/technicians.
       * Read Receipts/Timestamps: These features for chat messages are not implemented.
   6. Payments Integration: This is a significant missing piece. No API endpoints or services are in place for:
       * Initiating payment requests.
       * Integrating with payment gateways (Paystack/Stripe).
       * Handling payment webhooks or confirmations.
       * Storing transaction records in the database.
   7. Ratings & Reviews System: There are no database models or API endpoints for users to submit ratings and reviews for technicians after a job is completed.
   8. Dispute Resolution Workflow: While a DISPUTED status exists, there's no backend logic, models, or admin endpoints to manage, view, or resolve job disputes.
   9. JWT Refresh Tokens: The current authentication uses JWT access tokens, but there is no explicit implementation for refresh tokens to manage longer-lived sessions.
   10. Comprehensive Notification System: Beyond the basic job status notifications, the PRD mentions push notifications for all state changes and email receipts, which are not fully implemented.
